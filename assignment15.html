    <h3>Juan Pellot</h3>

    <p>Learning these skills about web systems and how they work will play an important role in finding a job in the IT field. I have reviewed quite a few postings for web developer and web design. I have identified my skill set and skills I need to develop to have the best chance to land these positions.</p>

    <p>Through my coursework, job, and personal projects, I have developed foundational skills that will be essential to have an opportunity to land a position as a web developer, which is something I look forward to doing in the future. I have built knowledge in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to help me build visually appealing web pages and with JSON I have learned to store the data and retrieve the information through the web application. I am very proud to have a solid foundation of basic programming concepts, algorithms, and debugging. While having these are a solid foundation and starting point to get your foot in the door, it is not enough to meet all the demands and qualifications many web development positions are asking for.</p>

    <p>There are many skills that would help me have a better opportunity to land these positions. Having the knowledge in front-end frameworks with tools like Angular and Vue.js are some quite common tools that employers are looking for you to have some experience and knowledge on. Backend Development goes hand in hand with Frontend Frameworks and knowing languages like Python, PHP, and Node.js. While looking through posting I did see a lot of job posts that were seeking knowledge and experience with database management with tools like MySQL and MongoDB, which are important for retrieving and storing data.</p>

    <p>I do plan to take my skills to the next level and try to help fill the lack of work experience with personal experience and projects. Things I am looking to do to help me accomplish that are by taking online courses and certifications on my own time. Learning backend development using Django and mastering GitHub, which I have used for this course, by taking the Git-focused training modules. One way to really demonstrate your knowledge and experience is to make personal projects and create a portfolio displaying skills with some of the knowledge they want you to have.</p>

    <p>Taking this class has given me a great foundation in web development and I plan on taking Web Development 2 next semester. I know to be able to land a job in this field, I will need to take my experience a bit further and focus on advancing my skills in the areas in web development where I need more in-depth knowledge and experience. I know by creating a portfolio and displaying my knowledge and work it will help me get a few interviews and grow my skills.</p>
